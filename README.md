# ðŸ¥žPancakeSwap Prediction Betting

## Getting Started
PancakeSwap runs a prediction game where users can bet on the next 5 minute price move's direction. The price feed uses Chainlink's oracle, and we discovered that most of the time there is a lagging relationship between Binance vs Chainlink.

- We define a premium threshold, when Binance's price for Cake deviates too much from Chainlink's last price, it is likely that Chainlink will take some time to catch up. Thus we will be quite certain about the next's prediction's direction.
- Fires a transaction when it closes in 4 blocks
- Claims reward when next round is more than 50 blocks away

Start the betting bot in `pancake_prediction.py`

pp = PancakePrediction(abi_name='pancake_bnb_prediction.abi',
                           config='pancake_bnb_prediction.ini',
                           address=address_dict['pancake_bnb_prediction_address'],
                           logging=True,
                           live=True,
                           claim=True)

_thread.start_new_thread(pp.start, ())
_thread.start_new_thread(pp.update_balance, ())
```

## Web3 Client

The contract is placed under the `assets` folder
- When a betting event is triggered, the bot calls the contract and place a bet

## Position Sizing
Kelly Criterion is used to size the bet. Either a historical winning rate can be assigned or a 50% winning rate can be assigned to be more conservative.
